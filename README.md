# Iris Classification


In my Iris classification project, I experimented with three different approaches to optimize performance. First, I implemented a standard model to classify the iris species. 
Next, I introduced dropout to assess its effect on improving model robustness and preventing overfitting. 
Finally, I created a version that splits the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data. These experiments allowed me to analyze how each method impacts accuracy and performance.
